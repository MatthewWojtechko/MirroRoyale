MirroRoyale is my first foray into the world of networked games. I began development in the Spring 2020 school year in a one-on-one networked game development course with my professor.
Programming a fully networked game by myself for the first time was very challenging, and the result of the class was a comprehensive prototype and many learned lessons.
